INTERNET PORTAL SOFTWARE VERSION 1.0 ("software") WRITTEN

There are several external pieces of code incorporated into
SkyPortal's code. Some of them have Limits to the way they
could be used. We want to make sure that everyone understand
these limitations as well the conditions under which they
could be used.

   1. TinyMCE: This is the HTML Rich Text editor used within
      SkyPortal. This editor is released and is Licensed

   2. SkyPortal Themes, Language Packs, Modules, and other
      Components: Dogg Software wants to make sure these
      users get the proper recognition as without them
      SkyPortal would not have the same library of themes
      and modules as it does. Themes and other modules
      are published by their individual authors and come
      with their own, separate licensing agreement which
      you must abide by. If a module is published by
      Dogg Software and does not come with its own, more
      specific license agreement, it is licensed under
      this master SkyPortal EULA.
